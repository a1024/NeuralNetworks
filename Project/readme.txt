Variational autoencoder-based image compression.


Build:

First compile 'ac.cpp' as a shared library
with the Makefile suitable for your OS.

Then run 'compression.py'.

Notes:

The variable 'pretrained' (0 or 1) controls wether
to continue training from a checkpoint or to start
from scratch.

The variable 'epochs' controls the number of epochs.
